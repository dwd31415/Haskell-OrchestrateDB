# How to install this package?

The most convenient way of installing this package is via Hackage, just click on the Hackage badge to get to the project's hackage site.
Alternatively, you could also just clone this repository and run the
```
cabal install
```
command in it.

# Where to find the documentation?

Haddock docs can be found on the hackage project site, but if you want to, you can also build them on your local machine by running
```
 cabal haddock --html
```

# Tests?

Some tests are run automatically after each commit over the Travis-CI service. If the Travis-CI badge says "build passing" everything should be fine.
